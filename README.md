#Villa.js

###Description
Villa.js was intended to be a module for node.js that helps makers easily build home automation and monitoring systems.
However, it seems that I prefer writing a full application over writing a simple module. Therefore, I will write the full application with a focus on 
reusability for deployment in any home and document the API endpoints so that people may develop their own applications to access it. A web
application will be included in the package for easy startup, but I am not a very good front-end designer, so it is likely that it will take some time
for the application to be worth using.

###Pricing
